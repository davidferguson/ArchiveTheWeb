# ArchiveTheWeb
Helping save the history of the web using the Internet Archive

Install the Chrome extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/archivetheweb/jgpbjlabbfodbjecclkddfnanflgkjfe

Have you ever found something on the internet that you thought might come in handy, only to come back later to find out that website no longer exists? Or has done a cleanup of its old pages? And even worse, that page wasn't crawled by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine?

ArchiveTheWeb aims to solve this. Every single time you visit a webpage, it sends that page off to be archived by the Wayback Machine. Meaning that you'll be able to access every single webpage that you've viewed.* Ever. It's like having your own personal web cache that never expires, you don't have to pay for, and doesn't take up any of your hard drive space!

But ArchiveTheWeb is about more than just that. Because although the Wayback Machine is great, it can't crawl everything. There are many websites that it has missed, and there are more that it will miss in the future. But you can help change that. By using this extension, you're helping the Internet Archive crawl the entire World Wide Web. You're making a difference, and one day a page that you helped archive will be used by someone else trying to find a forgotten piece of data. And because you used the ArchiveTheWeb extension, they'll find it.

So please install this extension, and help preserve the future of the Internet.

Please not that this extension sends the URLs of **all** the pages you visit to be archived by the WayBack Machine. This means that if the URL contains private or sensitive information (like in GET parameters), it will be sent to the WayBack Machine. If you're doing anything with sensitive information please make sure you have disabled this extension beforehand.
